# Torchradio

`torchradio` is a Python library for building differentiable RF simulations.

> [!NOTE]
> `torchradio` is *not* affiliated with the official PyTorch project.

## Installation

Install `torchradio` by running:

```
pip install torchradio
```

## Example

Below is a simple example that trains two radios via backpropagation to communicate over the same noisy channel:

```python
# Define the training environment
from torchradio import Transmitter, Receiver
from torchradio.algorithm.example import DenseRadio
from torchradio.env.null import RandomAWGNEnvironment

n_radios = 2
radio0 = DenseRadio(n_input_bits=8, tx_length_per_bit=4)
radio1 = DenseRadio(n_input_bits=8, tx_length_per_bit=4)
env = RandomAWGNEnvironment(p_min=0, p_max=1)
env.place(
    transmitters={"tx0": Transmitter(radio0.tx), "tx1": Transmitter(radio1.tx)},
    receivers={"rx0": Receiver(radio0.rx), "rx1": Receiver(radio1.rx)},
)


# Evaluate the initial radios
import numpy as np

def evaluate():
    simulation_logs = env.simulate(n_timesteps=10000, batch_size=10)
    tx_bits = {k: v.metadata["bits"] for k, v in simulation_logs.tx.items()}
    rx_bits = {k: v["bits"] for k, v in simulation_logs.rx.items()}
    for i in range(n_radios):
        print(f'radio{i} BER: {1 - float(np.mean((tx_bits[f"tx{i}"] == rx_bits[f"rx{i}"]).numpy())):.5f}')

evaluate()


# Define the training loop
import torch
from torch import nn

loss_fn = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([*radio0.parameters(), *radio1.parameters()])

def train(
    n_timesteps: int,
    batch_size: int,
) -> float:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    device_logs = env.simulate(n_timesteps, batch_size)
    tx_bits = {k: v.metadata["bits"] for k, v in device_logs.tx.items()}
    rx_outputs = {k: v["bit_probabilities"] for k, v in device_logs.rx.items()}
    loss = sum([
        loss_fn(rx_outputs[f"rx{i}"], tx_bits[f"tx{i}"].float())
        for i in range(n_radios)
    ])
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return loss


# Train the radios
for i in range(1000):
    loss = train(n_timesteps=64, batch_size=10)
    if i % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Loss at iteration {i}: {loss:5f}")


# Evaluate the trained radios
evaluate()

```

## Assumptions
- All events take place at baseband.
- All devices have the same centre frequency and bandwidth.
- `torchradio` is not intended to replace a high-fidelity simulation. Rather, it is a training ground for developing novel radios. If a radio looks promising, its parameters can be exported for testing in a high-fidelity simulation environment.


## Contributing

New contributors are always welcome! If you would like to contribute, it is recommended you set up your development environment using the following instructions.

Create a new Python virtual environment using your method of choice (e.g., `venv`, `conda`, `pyenv` etc.). Clone this repository and install using

```
pip install -e .[dev]
```

The above command will install `torchradio` along with its core dependencies, as well as dev-specific dependencies for formatting, linting and testing. The `-e` flag installs `torchradio` in editable mode, so you can quickly see the effects of local source code changes without reinstalling `torchradio`. You can test that everything is working as expected by running

```
pytest
```

To save failing GitHub Actions due to styling issues, set up the project's git hooks using:

```
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

You can view the documentation locally anytime by running:

```
mkdocs serve
```
